# Arduino-Project

This is a Sensors and Microcontroller Project here, we have made a mini-project which is based on Smart and Efficient Street Light System. The components used are 
i) Arduino Uno Board
ii) IR Sensors
iii) LDR Module
iv) Breadboard and Jumper Wires.

It detects the moving object i.e., car using IR Sensor and thus it increases the brightness of the particular LED, as soon the object is detected by the next IR then the LED is going to turn off.
